# Brain Bee Game
 A simple text-based Brain Bee Game built in Python to help middle and high school students to learn neuroscience an use this knowledge through a game.

 This project seeks to encourage young students to pursue a careers in Neuroscience and participate in their local Brain Bees and potentially the Interntional Brain Bee. The brain has many unsolved mysteries and the more people working on solving them (aka neuroscientist) the closer we can get to understand its complexity in health and disease. 

 ## Disclaimer
 I am a Python beginner and this project is part of my Final Project for [CodeinPlace2021](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/). I plan to keep working on it and refine it as I expand my Python knowledge. If you like this idea and want to collaborate, do not hesitate in contacting [me](https://www.juansanar.com/).
